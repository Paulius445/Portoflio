              <p>
                This was my main and final internship project.
                During this project I had a chance to apply my previous theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. <br><br>
              </p>
              <h4 style="font-size:larger">Task</h4>
              <p>
                I was given a brief with a real life scenario, where my main job was to design an ecommerce website for a furniture 
                and homeware retailer. The keypoints of the store were these:
                <li>It has to be functional and intuitive. </li>
                <li>Conveying the idea of sustainability and high quality. </li>
                <li>It has to have a minimalistic feel and look to it. </li> <br>
              </p>
              <h4 style="font-size:larger">Process</h4>
              <p>
                1. Analyzing the brief to clarify overall goals and objectives of the project. <br><br>
                2. Doing competitive and qualitative research. This helped me understand the market and user needs a lot better. <br><br>
                3. Analyzing findings of the research. This step was necessary to create valuable insights for the designing part. <br><br>
                4. Wireframing. It included both low and high fidelity wireframes. <br><br>
                5. Designing hi-fi screens and interfaces. Making sure the product is aesthetically pleasing and functional at the same time. <br><br>
                6. Testing/QA. In my opinion it is the most important bit of the process.
                This step was a part of all the previous steps, since I got a lot of feedback from the team after
                every checkpoint. It also included some usability testing during and after the design process. <br><br>
              </p>
              <h4 style="font-size:larger">Results and lessons</h4>
              <p>
                Project resulted in a better understanding of what the actual workflow in a real company looks like.
                Not to mention all the experience that I gained as a UX/UI designer.  <br>
                During the project I've learned a lot about the transition from your research findings to making a design that obeys them.
                As well as the importance feedback and communication in everyday's work.
